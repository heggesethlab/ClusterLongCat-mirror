We designed our app as a tool for comparing methods for clustering longitudinal categorical data. It supports doing cluster analysis on such data using a variety of appropriate clustering methods. For each method, it produces visualizations and statistics to help interpret the clustering assignments. We also allow for comparing different clusterings and producing clustering comparison statistics such as the adjusted Rand index. We include two data sets, but users could upload and analyze datasets of their choosing.
