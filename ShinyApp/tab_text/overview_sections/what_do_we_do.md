We designed our app as a helper tool for clustering longitudinal categorical data. It supports doing cluster analysis on such data using a variety of appropriate clustering methods. It then produces visualizations and statistics to help interpret the clustering assignments. We also allow for comparing different clusterings and producing clustering comparison statistics such as the adjusted Rand index. Additionally, users could upload and analyze datasets of their choosing.
