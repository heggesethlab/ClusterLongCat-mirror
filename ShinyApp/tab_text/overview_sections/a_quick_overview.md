Welcome to our summer research project website! Consisting of Dr. Heggeseth and three students, our research group focuses on clustering longitudinal categorical data.

What is **longitudinal categorical data**?

Think sleep: every night’s sleep varies in length; each moment can be put into one of the four categories: awake, REM, light sleep and deep sleep. It’s natural to think that the dissimilarity between any two nights’ sleep (sequences) can be quantified in many different ways. Our goal is to try and understand questions such as what factors determine the dissimilarity between two sleep sequences and what sequences are similar enough to be considered in the same group or, more formally, “cluster”.

Alternatively, cluster analysis could be used to measure cancer patients’ end-of-life care. Starting the day of their diagnosis, cancer patients frequently transition between home, hospitals, hospices and skilled nursing facilities (SNF). Given how patients transition between *spells* and their survival days, we seek to identify clusters of patients that could help healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.

- The concept of *spells* is frequently used in sequence analysis. A spell is a longitudinal subsequence in which the subject stays in the same state. Take a sequence $A−A−B−B−B−A$, for example, $A−A$, $B−B−B$, $A$ are each a spell, respectively.

Many methods we use come from genetics: each position in the DNA sequence contains one of the four nitrogenous bases: *A*, *T*, *G*, *C*. Geneticists try to find the similarity between DNA sequences, and their research methods extend to the realm of life trajectory analysis and cluster analysis.
