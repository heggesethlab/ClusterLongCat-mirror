K-medoids or Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm is a standard clustering technique. We pre-specify the number of clusters *k* that we expect the observations to divide into. Then, we set k observations as the *initial medoids*, the data points closest to the middle of clusters, and associate each data point with the closest medoid in order to form a cluster. We then update medoids based on these clusters and repeat the clustering process until the cluster assignments generally stay the same between iterations.
