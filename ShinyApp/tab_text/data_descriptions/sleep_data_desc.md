During a night’s sleep, people move between different sleep stages, which can be broadly classified as *Awake*, *REM*, *Light* and *Deep*. To pursue this idea, we are wearing Fitbit bio-trackers to track our own sleep stages and try to understand common patterns among the nights’ sleep. While there haven’t been validation studies on how closely measurements provided by FitBit conform to the real experienced sleep statements, we use this data due to its easy availability. The data was collected over a 10 week period of time.
