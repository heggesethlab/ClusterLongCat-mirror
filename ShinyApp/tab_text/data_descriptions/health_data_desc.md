From the day of diagnosis, cancer patients transition between spending time at different locations of care. Our dataset tracks patients as being in one of the following locations: *Home*, *Hospital*, *Hospice* and *Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)*. We intend to better understand the typical patterns of care by clustering patients based on their patterns of healthcare utilization. We use a synthetic data set made by one of Briannaâ€™s collaborators in order to protect patient privacy. We hope our work will be able to help health care professionals better shift resources and take care of their patients by understanding common patterns between them.
