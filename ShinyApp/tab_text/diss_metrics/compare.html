<tr class="odd">
<td>Chi-squared Distance</td>
<td>Chi-squared weights the squared differences for each state by the inverse of the overall proportion of time spent in the state</td>
<td>Sensitive to time spent in the states; gives more importance to a rare state than to a frequent state</td>
<td>Insensitive to the order and the exact timing of the states</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Longest Common Susbsequence</td>
<td>LCS corresponds to the number of elements in one sequence that can be uniquely matched with elements occurring in the same order in the other sequence</td>
<td>Stronger dependence on differences in the state distribution and the sequencing, especially the order of the most frequent states</td>
<td>Not too sensitive to timing; less dependence on differences in the consecutive times spent in the distinct states</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Gower Distance</td>
<td>An equal-weighted sum of position-wise mismatches between two categorical sequences over a common time period</td>
<td>Can be used for sequences of unequal length</td>
<td>Very sensitive to timing mismatches; when sequences are unequal length, it only compares sequences on the common time period</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Generalized Hamming Distance</td>
<td>A weighted sum of position-wise mismatches between two sequences where weights are state-specific</td>
<td>Intuitive</td>
<td>Only applies to pairs of sequences of the same length; very sensitive to timing mismatches and shifting of sequences</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Optimal Matching</td>
<td>A weighted sum of time shifts (indels) and a weighted sum of the mismatches (substitutions) after the time shifts</td>
<td>Indel costs allow us to control for admissible time warps in a sequence comparison, while substitution costs reflect state dissimilarities serve as weights for the remaining mismatches</td>
<td>The lack of sociological meaning of the operations and their costs; indel and substitution costs may not be well-chosen</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Optimal Matching Sensitive to Spell Length</td>
<td>A variant of OM that distinguishes two similar states in a spell of different lengths and makes indel and substitution costs depend on the spell length</td>
<td>Decrease in indels costs favors indels in longer spells instead of indels which would create or suppress spells</td>
<td>The lack of sociological meaning of the operations and their costs; decrease in substitution costs reverses the effect of encouraging the splitting of long spells, which makes it difficult to predict the sensitivity of the measure to spell lengths</td>
